Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n) - There is one loop which will run (times) directly in proportion to how large n is.

b) O(n^4) - There are 3 for loops that depend on n. The 4th for loop depends on k. Because 4 for loops run in proportion to how large n is. This will have exponential growth.

c) O(n) - O(bunnies) - we call bunnyEars once inside bunnyEars, so that will loop in proportion to how large "bunnies" is
